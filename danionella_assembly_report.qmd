## Dorado correct + hifiasm

All simplex reads, including all from ic_206 (ultra long protocol) and simplex extracted from ic_205 (duplex run) merged and corrected with Dorado correct, then assembled with hifiasm v0.25.0 in normal mode (ONT mode can only run on reads in fastq format & dorado correct outputs corrected reads as fasta)

## Matt's best previous assembly

Not sure exactly what Matt did, I'm guessing this might have only been reads from the ic_206 ultra long run.
